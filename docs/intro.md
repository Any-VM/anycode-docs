# Anycode<br><br>

## Introduction to Anycode

AnyCode, a project aimed at transforming code execution across virtual machines (VMs). Unlike conventional methods, AnyCode operates similarly to Kubernetes but with a focus on dynamic code execution across VMs, offering seamless load balancing similarly to CF Workers. Anycode has an API to send and receive data from the uploaded configuration files, while also having the ability for dynamic and static IPs (useful for proxies and such)

## Key Features

 - Dynamic code execution across VMs. 
 - Load balancing capabilities. 
 - API integration for data exchange with uploaded code modules.
