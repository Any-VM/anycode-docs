<Step>
## Setting Up a Testing Server

This is a Next.js development server and **should not be used for production**.

```
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

</Step>
<Step>
## Configuring .env

Now that you have a working local server, You're going to stop it and now you're going to make a .env file and follow the example below.

```bash title=".env"
DATABASE_URL=""
NEXTAUTH_URL=""
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=""
SENDGRID_API=""
EMAIL_FROM=""
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=""
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=""
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=""
# This can be changed to a password to any SMTP server
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=$SENDGRID_API
GITHUB_ID=""
GITHUB_SECRET=""
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=""
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```

</Step>
### Values

#### General

`DATABASE_URL` is the URL to your database. If you're using a local database, you can use `postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/anycode` as the value.

`NEXTAUTH_URL` is the public URL for your AnyCode instance.

`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a randomly generated string that is used to encrypt the email verification tokens. You can generate a string using `openssl rand -base64 32`.

### Email

`SENDGRID_API` can be used if you are using SendGrid to send emails.

`EMAIL_FROM` is the email address that will be used to send emails.

`EMAIL_SERVER_HOST` is the SMTP server host.

`EMAIL_SERVER_PORT` is the SMTP server port.

`EMAIL_SERVER_USER` is the SMTP server username.

`EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD` is the SMTP server password.

### OAuth

`GITHUB_ID` is the GitHub OAuth client ID.

`GITHUB_SECRET` is the GitHub OAuth client secret.

`DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` is the Discord OAuth client ID.

`DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` is the Discord OAuth client secret.

<Step>
## Deploying to Production

Next, setup PostgreSQL.
You can easily setup a PostgreSQL database using Docker by running `docker run --name anyvm-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replaceme -d postgres`, and updating your env file accordingly.

After you have created the .env file, make sure that your database is running, and run the following commands.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db
pnpm build
```

</Step>

Now you can start the server using `pnpm start`. You should now be able to access your AnyCode instance at localhost:3000, which you can proxy through something such as Nginx or Caddy to make it accessible from the internet.

</Steps>
